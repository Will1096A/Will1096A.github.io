          <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
             Hello, some things about me are that my goals are to be a ui/ux designer, motion graphics editor, videographer or at least something creative within the design field. I originally came to the college for architecture, however I felt that the program was too <em>technical</em> with not enough design elements. I later wanted to enter the graphic design program, however the job opportunities for this field started to become very limited with AI and high competition. 
            </p>

             I entered this program, <abbr title="Interactive Media Development">IMD,</abbr> to balance my career goals with job opportunies. Some more personal things about me aside from my goals are my hobbies, which happen to relate to these goals: I like to digitally paint, design, and sketch which is probably why I decided to pursue a career in the design/arts field. 
            </p>
            <ul>My favourite hobbies in-general are:
              <li>Reading</li>
              <li>Gaming</li>
              <li>Drawing</li>
            </ul>

        One of the best quotes that I've found to end this document is <q> <em>"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take" by Wayne Gretzky</em></q>
